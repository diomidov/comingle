# Installing a Comingle Server

These instructions on based on the more complicated
[installation instructions for Coauthor](https://github.com/edemaine/coauthor/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

## Test Server

Here is how to get a **local test server** running:

1. **[Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install):**
   `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh` on UNIX,
   `choco install meteor` on Windows (in administrator command prompt
   after [installing Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install))
2. **Download Comingle:** `git clone https://github.com/edemaine/comingle.git`
3. **Run meteor:**
   * `cd comingle`
   * `meteor npm install`
   * `meteor --settings settings.json`
   * (`meteor` is an alternative to the last command, but you'll get more
     plain settings instead of the default.)

Even a test server will be accessible from the rest of the Internet,
on port 3000.

## Public Server

To deploy to a **public server**, we recommend deploying from a development
machine via [meteor-up](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-up).
Installation instructions:

1. Install Meteor and download Comingle as above.
2. Install `mup` via `npm install -g mup`
   (after installing [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and thus NPM).
3. Edit `.deploy/mup.js` to point to your SSH key (for accessing the server),
   and your SSL certificate (for an https server).
4. `cd .deploy`
5. `mup setup` to install all necessary software on the server
6. `mup deploy` each time you want to deploy code to server
   (initially and after each `git pull`)

## MongoDB

All of Comingle's data is stored in the Mongo database
(which is part of Meteor).
You probably want to do regular (e.g. daily) dump backups.
<!--
There's a script in `.backup` that I use to dump the database,
copy to the development machine, and upload to Dropbox or other cloud storage
via [rclone](https://rclone.org/).
-->

`mup`'s MongoDB stores data in `/var/lib/mongodb`.  MongoDB prefers an XFS
filesystem, so you might want to
[create an XFS filesystem](http://ask.xmodulo.com/create-mount-xfs-file-system-linux.html)
and mount or link it there.
(For example, I have mounted an XFS volume at `/data` and linked via
`ln -s /data/mongodb /var/lib/mongodb`).

`mup` also, by default, makes the MongoDB accessible to any user on the
deployed machine.  This is a security hole: make sure that there aren't any
user accounts on the deployed machine.
But it is also useful for manual database inspection and/or manipulation.
[Install MongoDB client
tools](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/),
run `mongo comingle` (or `mongo` then `use comingle`) and you can directly
query or update the collections.  (Start with `show collections`, then
e.g. `db.messages.find()`.)
On a test server, you can run `meteor mongo` to get the same interface.

## bcrypt on Windows

To install `bcrypt` on Windows (to avoid warnings about it missing), install
[windows-build-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools)
via `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`, and
then run `meteor npm install bcrypt`.
